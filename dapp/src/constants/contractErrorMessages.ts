// VALIDATION:
// - This file is automatically validated during linting: `bun run lint`
// - Run validation manually: `bun run validate-errors`
// - Pre-commit hooks will catch mismatches before commits
// - CI/CD will fail if validation fails
//
// To validate the mapping is correct, call validateContractErrorMapping() during development.
// This will catch any mismatches between bindings and constants.
